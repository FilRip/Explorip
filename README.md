Windows Shell/Explorer Replacement. All languages supported.

Explorer

Launch Explorip without command line arguments (or a path to a folder) to use the new file explorer

You can manage explorer with tabs, and 2 explorer in same screen to more easily copy/paste between them.

You can open command prompt or powershell too in any tabs

Launch explorir with "useowncopier" in command line argument to intercept copy/paste with an icon in notification zone (like SuperCopier/UltraCopier/TeraCopy/...)



Taskbar
