Launch Explorip without command line arguments (or a path to a folder) to use the new file explorer

You can manage explorer with tabs, and 2 explorer in same screen to more easily copy/paste between them.

Launch Explorip with "taskbars" as command line arguments to use the new Taskbar Manager

Ideal to Windows 11 users to have a taskbar like Windows 10 and with toolbar

Support multi virtual desktop too



Desktop
-------
Launch Explorip with "desktops" as command line arguments to use the new desktop background
