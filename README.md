Windows Shell/Explorer Replacement


Launch Explorip without command line arguments (or a path to a folder) to use the new file explorer
You can manage explorer with tabs, and 2 explorer in same screen to more easily copy/paste between them.
You can open command prompt or powershell too in any tabs

Launch Explorip with "taskbars" as command line arguments to use the new Taskbar Manager
Ideal to Windows 11 to have a taskbar like Windows 10 and with toolbar

Launch explorir with "useowncopier" to intercept copy/paste with an icon in notification zone (like SuperCopier/UltraCopier/TeraCopy/...)
